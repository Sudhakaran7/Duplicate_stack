You are given an list of integers, find out whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the list such that the absolute difference between stack[i] and stack[j] is at most T 
and the absolute difference between i and j is at most K.

Input Description:
First line contains, n,K,T. n is the size of the list.(1<n,K,T<100).
Second line contains, n integers of elements in a single line.

Output Description:
Print True or False.
